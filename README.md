# Assembler in Deno!

I seek to build an assembler in Deno to help further my understanding of the stack, but primarily because I can.

## Installation

Use Deno [deno](https://deno.land/) to install this Assembler.

```bash
deno install # work in progress
```

## Usage

```bash
deno-assemble mips.asm
# Output goes here
# Or at least that's the goal
```
